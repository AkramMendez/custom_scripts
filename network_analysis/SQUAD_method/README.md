# SQUAD Implementation
This repository includes scripts to analyze the dynamics of gene regulatory networks using the SQUAD method, 
developed by Dr. Luis Mendoza at the Computational Biology Lab at UNAM. Please see the [CompBioLab website](http://compbiolab.biomedicas.unam.mx/).

## SQUAD protocol
Refer to the protocol [chapter](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8618-7_9) and [review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2012.00072/full) on the SQUAD (Standardized Qualitative Dinamycal Systems) to learn more about this method and its use in the dynamical modeling of regulatory networks.


This repository exemplifies the implementation of the SQUAD method.

CartoonNetwork.R file define the regulatory network shown in figure 1 of the protocol [chapter](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8618-7_9)

SQUADImplementation.R file exemplifies the simulation of the regulatory network model defined in the CartoonNetwork.R file, first as a boolean regulatory network model and later as a continuous regulatory network using the SQUAD method.
