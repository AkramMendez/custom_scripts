### Bioinformatics Analysis Scripts Repository

Welcome to my repository of bioinformatics analysis scripts. This repository contains a collection of scripts that I've developed for various bioinformatics tasks, including differential expression analysis, transcriptomics, epigenetics and custom downstream analyses.

### Contents
```
├── differentialExpression:  Analysis of RNA-seq data, 
                             quantification, annotation, differential expression, 
                             enrichment analysis.

├── downstream_analyses:     In-depth analysis of processed NGS data, 
                             statistical analysis, data visualization.

├── nf:                      NEXTFLOW pipeline scripts.

├── genomic_visualization:   Genome-wide signal visualization, 
                             metagene profiles, ideograms, 
                             UCSC genome browser.

├── genotypic_data_analysis: Processing SNP variant microarray data, 
                             filtering and annotation.

├── m6A_analysis:            Peak calling, m6A prediction,
                             differential methylation.

├── mapping:                 Mapping short and long-read NGS data to reference genomes, 
                             processing alignment files, downsampling and normalization.

├── nanopore_analysis:       Base-calling of Nanopore long-read data, 
                             signal processing and detection of m6A modifications. 

├── quality_control:         QC analysis and report generation.

├── quantification:          Transcript and gene-level quantification of RNA-seq data.

├── query_databases:         Fetching and querying data from public databases.

└── transcriptomics:         Transcriptome assembly, differential exon usage.
